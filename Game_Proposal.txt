Game Proposal

Title: Shinobi Adventure

Summary: An amateur ninja is in his adventure to gain essential skills and fight the potential enemies to reach the title of Kage (for the greatest shinobi in a region)

My goals that I plan to accomplish:
+ Having the characters animated like in video games
+ Every tool/skill/enemy has its own motion animated
+ Having platforms
+ Having the scrolling screen
+ Having the music turned on/off when needed
+ Saving the record of players who reached high scores
+ Having a nice menu of choices
+ Having clear instructions and easy ways to exit
+ Having the game’s difficulty increased gradually

My goals I hope to accomplish if I have time:
+ Having multiple levels and obstacles
+ Having multiple tilesets
+ Having multiple models of characters
+ Having the character reacting at the end of the game (crying when losing, celebrating when winning)
+ Having more decoration

Inspiration: from the Japanese manga series named Naruto, “it tells the story of Naruto Uzumaki, 
a young ninja who seeks to gain recognition from his peers and also dreams of becoming the Hokage, the leader of his village” (Wikipedia).
